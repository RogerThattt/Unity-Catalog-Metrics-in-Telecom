# Unity-Catalog-Metrics-in-Telecom


ðŸ“¡ Telecom Scenario with Unity Catalog Metrics
ðŸŽ¯ Business Metrics Defined in Unity Catalog
Metric Name	Definition
ARPU	Total Revenue / Total Users
Install_Base_Growth_Rate	% Increase in active subscribers month over month
Order_Fulfillment_SLA	% Orders delivered within promised SLA timeframe

These are defined once in Unity Catalog and tied to source tables.

ðŸ”— Linking Metrics to Data Assets
Metric	Source Tables & Models	Linked Dashboards
ARPU	billing.revenue, subscriber.base	"Monthly Financial KPIs"
Install_Base_Growth_Rate	subscriber.base, churn.predictions_model	"Subscriber Growth Trends"
Order_Fulfillment_SLA	orders, logistics, sla_breach_model	"Operational Efficiency"

ðŸ’° TCO vs. Business Impact Breakdown
Data Asset	TCO/Month	Metric Tied	Business Impact ($/Month)	ROI (Impact / Cost)
billing.revenue	$6,000	ARPU	$500,000	83x
subscriber.base	$4,000	ARPU, Install_Base_Growth_Rate	$300,000	75x
orders	$10,000	Order_Fulfillment_SLA	$80,000	8x
sla_breach_model	$9,000	Order_Fulfillment_SLA	$30,000	3.3x
support_logs	$12,000	(None Directly)	$5,000	0.4x

âœ… Decisions Enabled by Unity Catalog Metrics
Prioritize:

Improve billing.revenue pipelines and dashboardsâ€”they drive the highest ROI.

Invest in keeping subscriber.base accurate and fresh, as it supports two metrics.

Deprioritize / Optimize:

support_logs cost a lot and impact very little â†’ archive, downsample, or delay refresh.

Targeted ML Upgrades:

The sla_breach_model helps with Order_Fulfillment_SLA, but ROI is low â†’ revisit features, retrain, or combine with rules-based logic to reduce cost.
